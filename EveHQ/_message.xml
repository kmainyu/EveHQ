    <![CDATA[The Confessor, the first in a new line of Tech 3 Destroyers, will be making its debut in Rhea on 9th December. This ship contains 3 alternative modes which can be switched between on command to give different bonuses in each mode. This will obviously need to be added into HQF very shortly so I'm looking into how these separate modes will be implemented.<br /><br />Any ideas would be appreciated at <a href='http://newedentech.com/forum/index.php?topic=157.0'>the forums</a><br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br /><br /><br />- Drailen]]>
